      <h2> About us </h2>

      <p>
      <i>
        The goal of Citizen Scientist is to gamify and democratize medical research. Users can cultivate an identity
        around scientific inquiry as well as self-understanding without needing to spend their lives in grad school.
        We provide a curated newsfeed of relevant and actionable medical advice while connecting patients directly with the 
        medical research that concerns them most.  We seek to bring research to the patients, bring patients to the research, 
        create useful clinical survey data, and to create rational incentives for using fun tools for self-management of health.
